Xet Storage is enabled for this repo, but the 'hf_xet' package is not installed. Falling back to regular HTTP download. For better performance, install the package with: `pip install huggingface_hub[hf_xet]` or `pip install hf_xet`
The argument `trust_remote_code` is to be used with Auto classes. It has no effect here and is ignored.
